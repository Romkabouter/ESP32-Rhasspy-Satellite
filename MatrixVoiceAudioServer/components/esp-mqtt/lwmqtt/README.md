The "**L**ight **W**eight **MQTT**" library implements a MQTT 3.1.1 client that is optimized to be used in embedded and constraint systems. It can be used with any operating system and network stack and only requires a handful of callbacks for a full integration. The project is derived from the [Paho MQTT Embeded C](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.embedded-c), [gomqtt](https://github.com/gomqtt) and [mosquitto](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto) project.
